Commit from github creating error

Notes:
From this assignment, I learned more about the process of commiting, pushing, and pulling versions of repositories from and to GitHub. I have used GitHub a little bit in other classses, but I never understood the process that well. Here is the process as I now understand it:

1. To get updates from pc to GH:
    a. make updates
    b. commit your updates
    c. push these to GitHub

2. To get updates from GH to pc:
    a. make updates
    b. commit updates
    c. pull updates to pc

3. Sometimes if the same line is altered from multiple locations, you make have to resolve the merge. This is very straight forward in VS.
