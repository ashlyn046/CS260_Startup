# Song Share

Song Share is a social media app designed to deepen connections by sharing music. Users can share favorite songs on their profile, view and interact with a feed of friends' shared songs, and explore new music through their social network.

## Key Features

- **Song Sharing**: Post favorite songs to a personal profile or a public "Friends" feed.
- **Edit and Delete**: Users can manage both their song posts and comments.

Music is a universal language, and Song Share enhances this by creating a shared musical experience. Users can post, share, and discuss music, making it a platform to explore new songs and reconnect over shared tastes.
