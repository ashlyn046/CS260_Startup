# Song Share

# Design
Music is a powerful form of expression that can lead to deep human connections. The Song Share app allows individuals to connect with friends and family on another level by sharing their favorite songs. When users find a new song to obsess over, they will be able to share it to their profile. The posted song will then appear on a public feed for their friends to view and interact with. Additionally, when users find themselves on the hunt for new music, they can use the song share app to see what their friends have been listening to. In this way, the song share app is a social media to bring people together.

# Notes:
From this assignment, I learned more about the process of commiting, pushing, and pulling versions of repositories from and to GitHub. I have used GitHub a little bit in other classses, but I never understood the process that well. Here is the process as I now understand it:

1. To get updates from pc to GH:

    a. make updates

    b. commit your updates

    c. push these to GitHub


2. To get updates from GH to pc:

    a. make updates

    b. commit updates

    c. pull updates to pc
    

3. Sometimes if the same line is altered from multiple locations, you make have to resolve the merge. This is very straight forward in VS. 




#Notes: This is the code to shell into my server from terminal: ssh -i ~/Desktop/CS260/AshlynDunn16.pem ubuntu@172.31.40.250 (elastic ip address)
